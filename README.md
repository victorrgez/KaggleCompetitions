# Kaggle Competitions
Kaggle is a platform that offers a great variety of datasets which I find quite useful to practice my Data Science and Machine Learning Skills. All notebooks include graphs and descriptions in order to show what is being computed and predicted.

Here are some links to the datasets I have analysed:

[HousePricesPrediction](Code/HousePricesPrediction.ipynb)
[Titanic](Code/TitanicPassengersSurvivedOrDied.ipynb)
